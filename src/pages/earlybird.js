We decided to build a cross platform mobile app, that encouraged users to dedicate some time to their project in a gamified experience. Simply, A user would create a project, provide the project title, a pet name and assign days to work on. The user is given an egg that theyâ€™re responsible for. They nurture the egg by investing at least 5 minutes on their project on the selected days. The app provides statistics such as the project health, project completions, streaks and calendar info."]}
